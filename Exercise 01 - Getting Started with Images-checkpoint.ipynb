Along the way, you'll become familar with the images that you'll be using throughout this course, which are adapted from the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (VOC2007) dataset at http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/.\n\nLet's start by visualizing some of these images. They're stored in a folder hierarchy that contains a subfolder for each type of object shown in the image; so we'll display the first image in each folder.\n\n(To run the cell, place the cursor in it and click the  **&#9658;I Run** button. The **&#9711;** symbol next to the **Python 3.6** kernel name at the top right will briefly turn to **&#9899;** while the cell runs before turning back to **&#9711;**.)"

      "source": "A few things you should note about this code:\n1. It's common in computer vision scenarios to have images organized in folders based on their subject, or *class*. You should familiarize yourself with the [**os**](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html) library in Python, which provides lots of ways for you to work with the file system.\n2. The [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) library provides lots of ways to display plots and images. Note in particular that if you need to display multiple images, you can create a subplot for each image, The syntax for creating a subplot can be confusing; for each subplot you need to specify:\n    - The total number of *rows* in the grid of subplots to be displayed (this value must be the same for each subplot)\n    - The total number of *columns* in the grid of subplots to be displayed (again, this must be the same for each subplot)\n    - The ordinal position of \"this\" subplot in the grid (the first subplot should be numbered 1, the second 2, and so on)\n3. In addition to the Matplotlib library, there are other common libraries for working with images:\n    - [**PIL**](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (based on the **Pillow** fork)\n    - [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/)\n    - [**Scikit-Image**](https://scikit-image.org/)\n\nOf these, PIL is already installed in the Azure Notebooks environment, but we'll need to unstall the OpenCV library and upgrade SciKit-Image to the latest version using `pip`:"
